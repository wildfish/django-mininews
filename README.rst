Fork
====

The upstream project `django-mininews` has been replaced by `django-minipub <https://github.com/richardbarran/django-minipub`>_.

This is a fork of the original project, under limited maintenance for use in projects where it has not yet been replaced by minipub.

As such, this should not be used for new projects.


Original
========

Django-mininews is a basic tool for controlling the *publication* of objects.

Let's take an example: you have a 'news' application, that just consists of a
Article model. In the admin interface, mininews will add this fieldset:

.. image:: docs/img/mininews-fieldset.png

All articles will have the following 3 fields:

- status: usually 'draft' or 'published'.
- start: start date, defaults to whenever the status is changed to ``published``.
- end: end date; optional.

Articles can only be viewed in the public website **if** they are ``published``
**and** between the start and end dates.

In addition, we have a fieldset for showing various read-only status fields:

.. image:: docs/img/mininews-status-fieldset.png

These can be of use for tracking changes to an Article.

And that's it... Mininews is just an abstract Model, together with plenty of code - in the models,
views, admin and sitemap - to make the best use of it, that you will reuse
again and again throughout a project.

What can I use it for?
----------------------
Here are some examples of Mininews at work:

- `Minutes of the meetings of an association <http://www.saphra.org.uk/meetings/>`_.
- `Controlling the publication of the Events at a well-known racetrack <http://www.silverstone.co.uk/events/>`_.
- `Controlling when job offers are displayed <http://www.ipglobal-ltd.com/en/about/careers/>`_.

Alternatives
------------
There are several similar projects that take slightly different approaches
to publication control; usually they introduce more sophisticated control. A well-known
example is `django-reversion <https://github.com/etianen/django-reversion>`_.

Mininews is a very basic publication control tool, but works well on several production
websites. Its author has found it be a decent compromise between a tool that's too
basic to be useful, and too complex to be understood by its intended end users.
