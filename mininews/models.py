``MininewsModel`` is an abstract model that provides the following 3 fields:

- ``status``: a list of choices; default is 'draft' or 'published'.
- ``start``: a start date; defaults to date of publication.
- ``end``: an end date; optional.

Timestamps
----------
``MininewsModel`` also adds the following fields that get auto-updated and should
not be manually modified: ``created``, ``modified`` and ``status_changed``.

The concept of 'Live' objects
-----------------------------

Objects are usually considered 'live' **if** they are 'published'
**and** between the start and end dates - this is usually sufficient for them being available
to display in the public website.

``live()`` methods are available both as a chainable filter on a queryset,
and as an instance method. For example, if you have an ``Article`` model that uses ``MininewsModel``:

.. code-block:: python

    my_articles = Article.objects.live()

or

.. code-block:: python

    can_be_viewed = article1.live()

Extra statuses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Models can have more statuses than ``draft``, ``published`` -
:ref:`see here for more details<extra_statuses-label>`.

Sitemaps
~~~~~~~~
If you have defined a sitemap.xml, refer also to the :ref:`sitemaps page<sitemaps-label>`.
